## 1. Introduction

This project aims to develop FHIR profiles focused on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) for Nepal using the **One Health** approach, which integrates human, animal, Food and environmental health. The goal is to harmonize data representation to facilitate the exchange of health information across domains and enhance global AMR surveillance and management.

### What are FHIR Profiles?

FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard for healthcare data exchange. A FHIR profile customizes the FHIR standard to meet specific use cases. This project will define and refine profiles related to AMR, including the specific attributes, terminologies, and data structures needed for effective AMR monitoring and treatment.

## 2. How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in various forms: code, documentation, bug fixes, and feature requests. Here’s how you can get started:

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

To contribute, first fork this repository to your own GitHub account. This gives you a personal copy of the project where you can make changes.

### Step 2: Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your work. It’s essential that your branch name is descriptive, e.g., `add-AMR-profile-human-health` or `update-animal-health-profile`.

### Step 3: Make Changes

Work on your changes locally on the new branch. Please follow the guidelines listed in the sections below.

### Step 4: Test Your Changes

Ensure your contributions meet the required functionality and pass any tests (if applicable).

### Step 5: Submit a Pull Request (PR)

Once your changes are ready, open a pull request (PR) against the main repository. Ensure that your PR is detailed, including:

- A description of the change.
- The issue it addresses (if applicable).
- Any dependencies or related work.

## 3. Coding Guidelines

To maintain code consistency and ensure the quality of our work, please follow these coding guidelines:

- **Write clear, maintainable code**: Ensure that the code is well-documented and follows FHIR's best practices.
- **Use proper naming conventions**: Follow conventions that make it clear what the resource, profile, or element represents.
- **FHIR standards**: Adhere to FHIR specifications and the constraints defined in the project.

## 4. FHIR Profile Development

When contributing to the creation or modification of FHIR profiles for AMR, please consider the following:

- **Profiles should be modular**: Each profile should address a specific aspect of the AMR/One Health model (e.g., human health, animal health, environmental health).
- **Include necessary constraints**: Define constraints for data elements to ensure consistency in AMR data.
- **Terminology support**: Use appropriate terminologies, including those related to AMR (e.g., SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD) and One Health-specific terms.

### Profile Components:
1. **StructureDefinition**: Define how the resource will be structured.
2. **ValueSets**: Specify the permissible values for each data element.
3. **Extensions**: For data elements not covered by core FHIR resources, use extensions where appropriate.

## 5. Testing and Validation

Testing and validation are essential to ensure that the profiles conform to the FHIR standards and work in the intended use cases.

- **Conformance Testing**: Use tools such as FHIR validators to test the profiles you contribute.
- **Unit Tests**: If your contribution includes code changes, write unit tests to cover the new functionality.
- **Review against use cases**: Validate that your profiles align with the actual needs of AMR monitoring and the One Health approach.

---

## 6. Documentation

Clear documentation is vital for helping others understand and use the FHIR profiles you create. Please ensure the following:

- **Profile documentation**: Each profile should have detailed documentation explaining its purpose, structure, constraints, and expected use cases.
- **Code comments**: Where applicable, leave comments in the code to explain complex logic or assumptions.
